\title{Structure learning with Poisson models using the Or-LPGM algorithm}
\usage{
LPGM.ord(X, order, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the matrix of counts (n times p).}

\item{order}{the topological ordering of variables (names of nodes).}

\item{alpha}{the significant level of the tests.}
}
\value{
the estimated adjacency matrix of the graph.
}
\description{
This function estimates the adjacency matrix of a Local Poisson Graphical
Model (LPGM) given a matrix of counts and topological ordering, using
generalized linear models. It is a natural extension of the LPGM of Allen and
Liu (2013). See Nguyen et al. (2022) for details.
